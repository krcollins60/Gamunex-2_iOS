	 		<div class="scrolable-content">
	 			<p>GAMUNEX<sup>&reg;</sup>-C (immune globulin injection [human], 10% caprylate/chromatography purified) is indicated for the treatment<br/> of primary humoral immunodeficiency disease (PI), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP).</p>
	 			<p class="dinBold">Renal dysfunction, acute renal failure, osmotic nephrosis, and death may occur with immune globulin intravenous (IGIV) products in predisposed patients. Patients predisposed to renal dysfunction include those with any degree of preexisting renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, age greater than 65, volume depletion, sepsis, paraproteinemia, or patients receiving known nephrotoxic drugs. Renal dysfunction and acute renal failure occur more commonly in patients receiving IGIV products containing sucrose. GAMUNEX-C does not contain sucrose. For patients at risk of renal dysfunction or failure, administer GAMUNEX-C at the minimum concentration available and the minimum infusion rate practicable.</p>
	 			<p>GAMUNEX-C is contraindicated in individuals with acute severe hypersensitivity reactions to Immune Globulin (Human). It is contraindicated in IgA deficient patients with antibodies against IgA and history of hypersensitivity.</p>
	 			<p>GAMUNEX-C is not approved for subcutaneous use in patients with ITP or CIDP. <span class="dinBold">Due to the potential risk of hematoma formation, GAMUNEX-C should not be administered subcutaneously in patients with ITP.</span></p>
	 			<p>Hyperproteinemia, increased serum viscosity, and hyponatremia may occur in patients receiving IGIV therapy.</p>
	 			<p>Thrombotic events have been reported in association with IGIV. Patients at risk for thrombotic events may include those<br/> with a history of atherosclerosis, multiple cardiovascular risk factors, advanced age, impaired cardiac output, coagulation disorders, prolonged periods of immobilization and/or known or suspected hyperviscosity.</p>
	 			<p>There have been reports of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema [Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)], hemolytic anemia, and aseptic meningitis in patients administered with IGIV.</p>
	 			<p>The high dose regimen (1g/kg x 1-2 days) is not recommended for individuals with expanded fluid volumes or where fluid volume may be a concern.</p>
	 			<p>GAMUNEX-C is made from human plasma. Because this product is made from human plasma, it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, e.g., viruses, and, theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent.</p>
	 			<p>After infusion of IgG, the transitory rise of the various passively transferred antibodies in the patient's blood may yield positive serological testing results, with the potential for misleading interpretation.</p>
	 			<p>In clinical studies, the most common adverse reactions with GAMUNEX-C were headache, fever, chills, hypertension, rash, nausea, and asthenia (in CIDP); headache, cough, injection-site reaction, nausea, pharyngitis, and urticaria with intravenous use (in PI) and infusion-site reactions, headache, fatigue, arthralgia and pyrexia with subcutaneous use (in PI); and headache, vomiting, fever, nausea, back pain, and rash (in ITP).</p>
	 			<p>The most serious adverse reactions in clinical studies were pulmonary embolism (PE) in one subject with a history of PE<br/> (in CIDP), an exacerbation of autoimmune pure red cell aplasia in one subject (in PI), and myocarditis in one subject that occurred 50 days post-study drug infusion and was not considered drug related (in ITP).</p>
